            <h3 id="Control">Controls</h3>
                <p>
                    To move your Brawler, drag your finger on the left side of the screen to manipulate the virtual joystick, and your Brawler will move the direction that the joystick is pulled. Dragging your finger on the right side of the screen will manipulate the Attack joystick. Drag it to aim, and release it to fire. Alternately, the joystick can be tapped to perform a "quick-fire" (or auto-aimed) attack. This causes the Brawler to automatically fire once at the nearest target, or if none are in range, the Brawler fires toward the nearest damageable object (Players, Power Cube Boxes, etc.). To cancel an aimed shot, drag the Attack joystick back to its center.
                    <br>
                    Each Brawler has its own powerful Super ability. The Super is mainly charged by hitting enemy Brawlers. Once fully charged, it can be utilized with the yellow joystick located on the right side of the screen, below the Attack joystick. The Super will then be fired in the direction that the joystick is aimed in. Similar to the regular Attack joystick, the Super joystick can also be simply tapped to automatically fire the Super at the nearest target. The Super's charge is not lost if your Brawler is defeated. Like your Attack joystick, you can cancel your aimed Super by dragging the joystick back to its center.
                    <br>
                    The positions of the controls on the screen can be adjusted in the game settings.
                    <br>
                    Two or three status bars are displayed over your Brawler's head. The top one indicates how much health the Brawler has remaining. Health is lost as the Brawler takes damage, and if the Brawler's health reaches zero, the Brawler is defeated. If the Brawler does not attack or take damage for 3 seconds, its health will start to regenerate over time by 13% of their maximum health. The second bar has segments that indicate how many attacks the Brawler has ready. Most Brawlers can have a maximum of three attacks ready at once, and each attack empties one full segment. Attacks regenerate automatically over time. A third bottom bar may be present, which may indicate a countdown of the time duration of a Gadget or a certain charge a Star Power needs to be in effect. This bar is yellow when partially filled and is maroon when fully charged.

                    <br>
                    Brawlers have one or two selectable Gadgets, two Star Powers, and a Hypercharge. Gadgets are active abilities that can be unlocked after a Brawler is at least Power Level 7. All Gadgets are activated by a button, have unlimited uses, and have a cooldown between uses. Unless otherwise stated, Gadgets do not charge up a Brawler's Super, or reveal Brawlers in bushes.
                    <br>
                    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/8/84/ReloadGear.png/revision/latest?cb=20221104041206" alt="A Gear" width="75">
                    <br>
                    Gears are passive abilities that can be unlocked after a Brawler is at Power Level 8. Gears are locked for a specific Brawler. After upgrading a Brawler to Power Level 10, they can be equipped with two Gears at a time.
                    <br>
                    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/a/a8/SP-Shelly1.png/revision/latest?cb=20211102023703" alt="A Star Power" width="75">
                    <br>
                    Star Powers are passive abilities that can be unlocked after a Brawler is at Power Level 9. Unlike Gadgets, they do not require a button to activate, have no cooldown, and can be used indefinitely. Only Star Powers that actively deals damage, raise a Brawler's max health, or heal Brawlers will reveal Brawlers inside bushes.
                    <br>
                    Hypercharges are active abilities that can be unlocked after a Brawler is at Power Level 11. The Hypercharge is mainly charged by hitting enemy Brawlers. Once fully charged, it can be utilized with the purple button located on the right side of the screen, below the Super joystick. All Hypercharges are activated by a button, last for 5 seconds, have no cooldown, and can be used indefinitely. While activated, Brawlers will have a purple flame, additional Supers abilities, while also gaining speed, damage, and shield boosts. Using a Hypercharge will not reveal Brawlers in bushes.
                    <br>
                    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/e/ea/Shelly-Hypercharge.png/revision/latest?cb=20240830000355" alt="A Hypercharge" width="75">
                    <br>
                    Some Brawlers have a Trait, a passive ability active on all Brawlers with that Trait regardless of their Power Level.

                <p>
                    Battles are started in the Brawl tab. There are 8 main Event types: <a href="#Showdown">Solo Showdown</a>, <a href="#Duo Showdown">Duo Showdown</a>, <a href="#Brawl Ball">Brawl Ball</a>, <a href="#Gem Grab">Gem Grab</a>, <a href="https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Knockout">Knockout</a>, <a href="https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Heist">Heist</a>, <a href="https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Zone">Hot Zone</a>, <a href="https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Duels">Duels</a>, <a href="https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Bounty">Bounty</a> and <a href="https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Wipeout">Wipeout</a> in which you battle against other players. Each Event has a different main objective. See their individual pages for more information.
                    <br>
                    Up to 7 different events can be active at any one time. The time before the next rotation for an Event Slot is displayed in that slot. When that time is reached, a new Event begins and 5 free XP can be claimed by simply tapping the Event slot.
                    <br>
                    Playing matches earns you XP from your XP bank, which are used to progress on the Brawl Pass. The XP bank can hold up to 200 XP at a time, and 20 XP are re-added to the bank every 2 hours and 24 minutes, capped at 200. If you earn all of the XP in the bank, you can come back later to earn more.
                    <br>
                    In addition to the normal Events, a Special Event opens every weekend in the fourth event slot. With the exception of Heist and Hot Zone, they are not ranked, meaning that winning or losing in these events does not affect one's Trophy count. These Events award great amounts of XP in the form of quests. The Special Event can be either Heist, Hot Zone, Big Game, Boss Fight, or Robo Rumble.

                <h4 id="Showdown">Solo Showdown</h2>
                    <p>
                        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/7/73/Showdown.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/90?cb=20240913100459" alt="Solo Showdown" width="75">
                        <br>
                        In the Solo Showdown Event, there are 10 players with no teams. The objective of the game is to defeat all of the opponents and be the last <a href="https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Brawler">Brawler</a> standing. You can obtain Power Cubes by defeating enemy Brawlers or by opening Power Cube Boxes. The health of Power Cube Boxes depends on the average Power Level of all players, having a maximum health of 8500 and a minimum health of 4500. Power Cubes increases the Brawler's health by 400 and increases their attack stats by 10% linearly for the duration of the match, acting as temporary Power Level buffs for attacks, Supers, Gadgets, and Star Powers. The number of Power Cubes dropped by an enemy Brawler is one plus a third of the number of Power Cubes the enemy had, and is capped at 5. The more players you outlive, the more <a href="https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Trophies">Trophies</a> and <a href="https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/XP">XP</a> you will receive. As the match progresses, a deadly poison gas blows in from the edges of the arena, forcing all Brawlers into a progressively smaller area. The poisonous gas reduces all healing sources by 50%, deals 20% of a Brawler's maximum health per second, and staying in it for more than 5 seconds will increase its damage by 5% per tick. On some maps there is a <a href="https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Modifier">Modifier</a> active which introduces an additional special condition to the matches.
                    </p>
                <h4 id="Duo Showdown">Duo Showdown</h2>
                    <p>
                        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/c/c6/Duo_Showdown.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/90?cb=20241019214017" alt="Duo Showdown" width="75">
                        <br>
                        Duo Showdown is similar to Solo Showdown except there are 5 teams of 2 players each. Each team's goal is to eliminate the other 4 teams and be the last team standing.
                        <br>
                        When a Power Cube is gained, it is shared between both teammates, if they are both alive. If a player is defeated and their teammate remains alive, they will respawn after 15 seconds. When they respawn, they will start over with no Power Cubes, and have an immunity shield for 3 seconds. If both players in a team are defeated at once, that team is eliminated.
                    </p>
                <h4 id="Brawl Ball">Brawl Ball</h4>
                    <p>
                        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/4/48/Brawl_Ball.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/90?cb=20200304181916" alt="Brawl Ball" width="75">
                        <br>
                        In the Brawl Ball Event, there are two teams consisting of three players each. The objective is to take the ball (which starts in the middle) to the opposite team's goal and score. The team that scores two goals first wins, or the team with the most goals scored when the timer ends. If the timer ends while the teams are tied, the game will go into overtime for 1 minute and all map obstacles will be destroyed. If it is still a tie at the end of overtime, the game ends in a draw.
                        <br>
                        Brawlers can obtain the ball by getting close enough to it while no other Brawler has it. Attacking with the ball kicks it a certain distance and uses up an ammo bar (unless the Brawler has only one ammo bar, like Carl, Bea, Bonnie, Charlie, Angelo, Amber, Hank, or Draco in the alternate form). Shooting the ball with your Super shoots it further and faster, but uses up the Super. The ball can bounce off walls and most obstacles. Auto-aiming an attack or Super with the ball will kick the ball towards the center of the enemy goal line. Gadgets cannot be used if you are holding the ball (though can be in effect while holding the ball). If the ball carrier is stunned, knocked back, or defeated, they will drop the ball.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    In the Gem Grab Event, there are two teams consisting of three players each. In the middle of the arena, there is a gem mine that produces purple Gems every 7 seconds. The objective of the game mode is for your team to obtain 10 Gems. When a player is defeated, they will drop all of the Gems that they have picked up. Once a team has 10 Gems, a countdown will appear on screen which lasts 15 seconds. If the counter reaches 0, the team that activated the countdown will win. The countdown will stop and reset if a Brawler is defeated and drops enough Gems for their team to drop below 10, or if the other team accumulates the same amount of Gems. If both teams have more than 10 Gems and the same number of Gems, the countdown will not start until one team has more Gems than the other.
                    <br>
                    There can never be more than 29 Gems in play at once (unless the Angry Robo <a href="https://brawlstars.fandom.com/wiki/Modifiers">Modifier</a> is active). When the 29th Gem is spawned, a 30-second countdown will begin. Once this timer expires, the game will end, and the team holding the most Gems will win. When 15 Gems are lying on the map, the mine will not produce any more Gems until a Brawler picks one up.
